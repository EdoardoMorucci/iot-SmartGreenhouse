Development of a greenhouse monitoring system that leverages the power of IoT  technology.

Project completed for the “Internet of Things” exam.

## Short Description

This project is dedicated to the development of a sophisticated greenhouse monitoring system that leverages the power of IoT (Internet of Things) technology. It addresses the crucial need for maintaining optimal conditions in greenhouses, allowing crops to flourish throughout the year. The project employs a dual-network approach, utilizing MQTT and CoAP, to collect a diverse range of data from various sensors. These sensors include those monitoring temperature, soil humidity, and other key parameters vital to greenhouse management.

All the collected data is efficiently processed and managed by a central collector, and it's stored in a MySQL database for further analysis. To interact with the system, users have access to a user-friendly command line interface. This interface offers real-time updates and the ability to access historical data.

Moreover, the project includes an intuitive web interface powered by Grafana. This interface presents a visual representation of the sensor data, providing users with a comprehensive overview of the greenhouse's conditions. This holistic monitoring system ensures that greenhouse operators can make informed decisions, optimizing crop cultivation and overall greenhouse management.
